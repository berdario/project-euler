Personal repository contaning some solutions of project euler problems
It's not comprehensive since I never planned on doing all the problems, but I realized that I was solving some of them while not having set up a place, and thus I was forgetting where I stored them (or if I deleted them)
...also: since I'm doing it casually, sometimes I've solved the same problem with more than one programming language with the aim of getting a better hand at that language
